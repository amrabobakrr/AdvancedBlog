## 📱 Responsive Design

This blog layout adjusts nicely on smaller screens thanks to CSS media queries.  
You can test it by shrinking your browser window or opening it on your phone.


## 🧠 Notes

- All styles are handled in one CSS file — no frameworks used.
- JavaScript functionality is placed inline at the bottom of `index.html`, so no external JS file is required.
